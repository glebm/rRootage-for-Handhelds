rRootage-for-Handhelds
======================

An OpenGLES conversion of Kenta Cho's rRootage bullet-hell shooter game, intended for low-res handheld game systems. Supports optionally-rotated-90-degree game screen, 320x240 resolution, and customization of controls. It can optionally be compiled with fixed-point math in place of much of the original float math, for systems with no FPU.

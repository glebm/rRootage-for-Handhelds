rRootage-for-Handhelds
======================

An lowres-handheld-oriented OpenGLES conversion of Kenta Cho's rRootage bullet-hell shooter game. Supports optionally-rotated-90-degree game screen and 320x240 resolution. Can be optionally be compiled with support for fixed-point math for systems with no FPU, since much of the game's math has been duplicated into fixed-point form.
